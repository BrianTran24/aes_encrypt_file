# iOS CocoaPods Migration Notes

## Current Status: ✅ No CocoaPods Integration

This Flutter plugin has been verified to work **without CocoaPods integration**. The project is ready for Flutter 3.24+ which prefers Swift Package Manager.

## What Was Verified

### 1. ✅ Clean xcconfig Files
- `example/ios/Flutter/Debug.xcconfig` - Contains only `#include "Generated.xcconfig"`
- `example/ios/Flutter/Release.xcconfig` - Contains only `#include "Generated.xcconfig"`
- No references to `Pods/Target Support Files/...`

### 2. ✅ No Podfile
- No `Podfile` exists in `example/ios/`
- No Pod dependencies to migrate

### 3. ✅ No Pods Directory
- No `Pods/` directory exists in `example/ios/`
- No CocoaPods integration artifacts present

### 4. ✅ Clean Workspace
- `Runner.xcworkspace` only references `Runner.xcodeproj`
- No `Pods.xcodeproj` reference

### 5. ✅ Proper .gitignore
- `Pods/` directory is already in `.gitignore`
- CocoaPods artifacts won't be committed accidentally

## Plugin Structure

The plugin maintains its native iOS implementation in:
```
ios/
├── Classes/
│   ├── AesEncryptFilePlugin.h
│   ├── AesEncryptFilePlugin.m
│   ├── crypto_engine.c
│   └── crypto_engine.h
└── aes_encrypt_file.podspec  (for backwards compatibility only)
```

## About the .podspec File

The `aes_encrypt_file.podspec` file is kept for **backwards compatibility** with Flutter versions < 3.24 that still use CocoaPods. However:

- Flutter 3.24+ can use this plugin **without** CocoaPods
- The plugin's native code (C/Objective-C) is directly accessible
- No CocoaPods dependencies are required (uses iOS CommonCrypto framework)

## Dependencies

This plugin has **NO** CocoaPods dependencies. It only uses:
- iOS `Security` framework (built-in)
- CommonCrypto (built-in)
- Standard C libraries

## For Users

### Flutter 3.24+ Users
Your project will automatically use this plugin without CocoaPods. No special configuration needed.

### Flutter < 3.24 Users
The plugin will work through CocoaPods integration using the provided `.podspec` file.

## Build Time Improvement

By removing CocoaPods integration from the example app:
- ✅ Faster build times (no pod install step)
- ✅ Smaller repository (no Pods directory)
- ✅ Simpler project structure
- ✅ Better compatibility with Swift Package Manager

## Migration Checklist (Completed)

- [x] Remove CocoaPods references from `Debug.xcconfig`
- [x] Remove CocoaPods references from `Release.xcconfig`
- [x] Verify no `Podfile` exists
- [x] Verify no `Pods/` directory exists
- [x] Verify workspace doesn't reference CocoaPods
- [x] Confirm `.podspec` is for backwards compatibility only
- [x] Verify plugin uses only built-in iOS frameworks

## Result

The plugin is now fully compatible with Flutter 3.24+ and Swift Package Manager, while maintaining backwards compatibility through the `.podspec` file.
